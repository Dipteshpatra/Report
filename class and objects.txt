what is class and Object:-
A class is a user-defined type that describes what a certain type of object will look like. 
A class description consists of a declaration and a definition. Usually these pieces are split into separate files.
An object is a single instance of a class. 
You can create many objects from the same class type.
use of class:-
for code reusebility we mainly use class.
CONSTRUCTOR:-
Constructors have the same name as the class or struct, and they usually initialize the data members of the new object.
in dot net frame work constructors are automaticly created.
Access modifiers:-

Modifier	Description
public:-  The code is accessible for all classes
private:-he code is only accessible within the same class
protected:-The code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited from that class. 
internal:-The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly.

INHERITANCE:-
Derived Class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
Base Class (parent) - the class being inherited from.
To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.
example:-
class Animal  // Base class (parent) 
{
  public virtual void animalSound() 
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig : Animal  // Derived class (child)
